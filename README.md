# Quantum-Mechanics
Here, I present a focused set of notes that elaborate on the mathematical structures underlying foundational topics in quantum mechanics. The exposition is primarily guided by Griffiths as the main reference, but the emphasis is placed on making the mathematical logic explicit and coherent rather than merely reproducing standard derivations. The goal is to clarify how the formalism arises, how different mathematical tools fit together, and how they support the physical interpretation of quantum theory, providing a bridge between introductory treatments and more abstract, theory-oriented perspectives.
